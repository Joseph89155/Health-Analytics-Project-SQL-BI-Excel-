# Health Analytics Project 🏥📊

This Health Analytics project focuses on analyzing OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) patient data to uncover trends and insights based on gender, ethnicity, obsession/compulsion types, and diagnosis timelines. Using SQL for data cleaning and exploration, the processed data was then visualized in both Power BI and Excel dashboards.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To derive meaningful insights from OCD patient data, helping healthcare professionals understand demographic distributions, diagnose patterns over time, and identify the most common types of obsessions and compulsions. The aim was to present findings in clear, interactive dashboards for data-driven healthcare decisions.

## ❓ Key Questions / KPIs

1. What is the **count and percentage of Male vs Female** patients diagnosed with OCD?
2. What is the **average obsession score** by gender?
3. What is the **patient count by ethnicity** and their **respective average obsession scores**?
4. How many **OCD diagnoses occurred month over month (MoM)**?
5. What is the **most common obsession type**, and what is its **average obsession score**?
6. What is the **most common compulsion type**, and what is its **average compulsion score**?

## 🔄 Process

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning (SQL)**  
   - Removed duplicates and nulls  
   - Standardized column formats and corrected inconsistencies  
   - Extracted necessary metrics and grouped data using SQL queries

2. **Metric Calculation (SQL)**  
   - Performed gender distribution analysis  
   - Calculated average obsession/compulsion scores  
   - Aggregated monthly diagnosis counts and ethnicity breakdowns  
   - Identified most frequent types of obsession/compulsion

3. **Visualization (Power BI & Excel)**  
   - Imported cleaned data into Power BI and Excel  
   - Built multi-page dashboards with line graphs, bar charts, donut charts  
   - Visualized time series trends, score distributions, and categorical breakdowns
